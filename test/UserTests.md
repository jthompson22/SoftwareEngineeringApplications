User Test Documentation

Users were asked to sit down and go through the data entry process 3 to 4 times. No instructions on how to use the system were given, and both users seemed to understand the system after a couple of entries.

The first user was a friend that is a electrical engineering major. He is used to using web applications and data entry programs like this.
The second user was Axel's mom, who does a lot of data entry for her job.

Feedback from User 1:

 - Interface feels relatively simple and easy to use
 - Having to select how many values to enter for before actually entering data feels clunky and slow
 - Fix broken links on the site in order to 

Feedback from User 2:

 - The website looks nice, but the extra buttons are confusing
 - The text entry boxes feel small
 - Having to submit twice is unclear, felt like they had put in all the data and then had a bunch of extra boxes pop up.

The biggest point of feedback from both users was to get all of the extra buttons on the side of the page either taken off or linked to places that actually did stuff. In addition to that, both users had difficulty navigating back to the data entry page since the button from the redirect page did not take you to the right place.

From this testing it was learned that users expect fully functional systems, and even small bugs or broken links can lead to frustration with the system. Fixing the bugs in the system should be the highest priority going forward, and then focusing on the quality of life changes afterwards.
